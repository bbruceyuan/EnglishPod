                <p>And so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project. As you know, you’ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team’s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.</p>

                <p>I know, I’m really sorry that I missed the dead- line. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn’t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analyis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my deadline.</p>

                <p>Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You’re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than ac- cepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.</p>

                <p>No, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn’t gone down. And you know, with everything I’ve got going on now, I can’t afford to waste time dealing with tech- nical problems. I’ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day...</p>

                <p>I’m not going to accept this excuse. You’re us- ing these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you’ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I ex- pect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney excuses. If you’re in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by nine am!</p>
