                <p>We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations. Three of these involved our own country. Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world. We are understandably proud of this pre- eminence, yet we realize that America’s leader- ship and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the in- terests of world peace and human betterment.</p>

                <p>We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs sat- isfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings; that those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibilities; that all who are in- sensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; that the scourges of poverty, disease and igno- rance will be made to disappear from the earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.</p>
